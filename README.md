# Homework 2: Blockbuster Movies Visualization

By: Min Yan BEH (mbeh)

The dataset was retrieved from [Kaggle's "The Movie Dataset"](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset), which is a MovieLens dataset. MovieLens is a non-commercial site that provides movie recommendations for free.

For the purpose of this application, I've only extracted a subset of this dataset (reduced size from 34MB to 2MB) to include high-grossing movies and only movies from 1952 onwards.
